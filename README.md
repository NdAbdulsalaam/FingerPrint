### Combined Idea: CVD Risk and Management Web App

### Key Features

#### 1. **Personalized Risk Assessment and Management Dashboard**
- **Functionality:** Users input personal information, health metrics, and lifestyle data to receive a personalized CVD risk assessment. The dashboard will provide a clear visual representation of their risk level and offer actionable insights.
- **Development Focus:** 
  - User registration and profile setup
  - Data input forms for health metrics (age, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.)
  - Risk assessment algorithm (simplified for hackathon purposes)
  - Visual risk level display (charts/graphs)

#### 2. **Customized Health and Lifestyle Recommendations**
- **Functionality:** Based on the risk assessment, the app provides personalized recommendations for diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to mitigate CVD risk.
- **Development Focus:** 
  - Recommendations engine that generates tailored advice
  - Basic library of diet plans, exercise routines, and lifestyle tips
  - Integration of educational content related to CVD prevention

#### 3. **Medication and Appointment Reminders**
- **Functionality:** Users can set up reminders for medication and medical appointments. This feature helps ensure adherence to treatment plans and regular check-ups.
- **Development Focus:** 
  - Reminder setup interface
  - Notification system (email/SMS reminders)
  - Calendar integration for tracking appointments

#### 4. **Progress Tracking and Goal Setting**
- **Functionality:** Users can set health goals (e.g., weight loss, exercise frequency) and track their progress over time. The app provides visual feedback on goal achievement and improvements in health metrics.
- **Development Focus:** 
  - Goal setting interface
  - Progress tracking dashboard with visual elements (charts/graphs)
  - Historical data view to monitor improvements over time

### Development Plan (High-Level)

1. **Day 1: Setup and Core Features**
   - Set up Django project and initial app structure
   - Implement user registration and profile setup
   - Develop data input forms and basic risk assessment algorithm
   - Create the personalized dashboard with risk visualization

2. **Day 2: Additional Features and Refinements**
   - Build the recommendations engine and integrate content
   - Implement medication and appointment reminder system
   - Develop progress tracking and goal setting features
   - Test and refine the application to ensure a smooth user experience

Focusing on these features will allow you to create a comprehensive web app that addresses both CVD risk assessment and ongoing management, providing valuable support to users within the limited time frame of the hackathon.
